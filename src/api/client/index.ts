// TODO(ryanouellette): I don't like this name for the Myco-API stuff, but I'm not sure of a naming methodology
// as yet. Had Myti at first but didn't like that that mismatched with MycoClient, and didn't seem right
// to call the client a MytiClient, but maybe that's the best place to land for now until we develop a
// names, convention, methodology. Brainstorm with ben@ as time allows.
