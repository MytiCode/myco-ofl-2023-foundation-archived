# Changelog

All notable changes to the MyCo OFL project archival process.

## [Archive Process] - 2025-10-24

### Repository Reorganization

This date marks the **archival and reorganization** of the MyCo Order Fulfillment & Logistics project repositories.

### Context

The project had two versions:
1. **Original 2023 foundation** - Clean, working codebase from April-May 2023
2. **2025 iteration** - Extended version with accumulated technical debt and maintenance issues

**Decision:** Archive both versions and preserve them for reference, with intent to rebuild properly from the foundation when ready.

### Changes Made

#### Repository: myco-ofl-2023-foundation-archived

**Created:** 2025-10-24

- Renamed from `myco-web` to `myco-ofl-2023-foundation-archived`
- Added comprehensive README explaining:
  - Original purpose (Order Fulfillment & Logistics tool)
  - Key features (pickup sheets, packing slips, delivery labels, tracking sheets)
  - Tech stack (Next.js 13.2.4, TypeScript, Tailwind, Playwright)
  - Development timeline (April-May 2023)
  - Archive status and reasoning
- Added prominent archive notice
- Cross-linked to abandoned 2025 version
- Archived repository on GitHub (read-only status)

**Repository URL:** https://github.com/MytiCode/myco-ofl-2023-foundation-archived

**Commits:**
- `4595e1b` - Update README with clear project description and rename to MyCo OFL 2023
- `fc41c25` - Mark repository as archived foundation version

#### Repository: myco-ofl-2025-abandoned

**Renamed:** 2025-10-24

- Renamed from `myco-ofl-2023` (which was previously `myco-web`) to `myco-ofl-2025-abandoned`
- Updated README with:
  - Prominent abandonment notice
  - Explanation of technical issues leading to abandonment
  - Cross-link to clean 2023 foundation
  - Preservation of all original feature documentation
- Disabled GitHub Actions workflows (removed Playwright CI)
- Archived repository on GitHub (read-only status)

**Repository URL:** https://github.com/MytiCode/myco-ofl-2025-abandoned

**Commits:**
- `d36de16` - Mark repository as abandoned
- `fc02342` - Disable GitHub Actions workflows

### Rationale

**Why Archive Both?**

1. **2023 Foundation:**
   - Represents clean, working baseline
   - Contains core functionality without accumulated technical debt
   - Serves as reference for future proper rebuild
   - Documents original architecture and design decisions

2. **2025 Abandoned:**
   - Shows advanced features attempted (Shopify integration, mobile interfaces, exception management, route optimization)
   - Documents lessons learned
   - Preserves work for reference (what worked, what didn't)
   - Prevents confusion about project status

**Why Not Continue the 2025 Version?**

The 2025 iteration accumulated issues requiring constant workarounds and undoing of changes. Clean slate approach from solid foundation deemed more efficient than continued remediation.

### Technical Details

**Foundation Version Includes:**
- Next.js 13.2.4 application
- TypeScript with strict typing
- JWT authentication
- Order/LineItem/Shop data models
- Document generation (printable fulfillment docs)
- Playwright E2E tests
- Tailwind CSS styling

**Abandoned Version Included (Additional):**
- Mobile pickup interface (`/mobile-pickup`)
- Shopify API integration (sustainlocal.myshopify.com)
- Exception management system
- What3Words location integration (partial)
- Offline queue system
- Delivery photo capture
- Admin dashboard
- Route optimization (in progress)

### Next Steps

When ready to resume development:
1. Clone `myco-ofl-2023-foundation-archived`
2. Create new active repository (e.g., `myco-ofl` or `myco-ofl-v2`)
3. Reference abandoned version for feature ideas and lessons learned
4. Build incrementally with proper architecture from the start

### Files Modified

**myco-ofl-2023-foundation-archived:**
- `README.md` - Added archive notice and comprehensive documentation

**myco-ofl-2025-abandoned:**
- `README.md` - Added abandonment notice
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Removed (disabled CI/CD)

### Maintenance Notes

- Both repositories are **archived** (read-only on GitHub)
- No further commits will be accepted
- GitHub Actions disabled to prevent unnecessary notifications
- Repositories preserved indefinitely for reference
